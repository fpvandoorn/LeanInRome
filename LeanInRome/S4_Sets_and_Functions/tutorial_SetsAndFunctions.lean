-- A double inclusion
example (α : Type) (S T W : Set α) (hST : S ⊆ T) (hTW : T ⊆ W) : S ⊆ W := by sorry













-- Self-intersection is the identity, proven with **extensionality**
example (α : Type) (S : Set α) : S ∩ S = S := by sorry













-- The difference
example (α : Type) (S T : Set α) (h : T ⊆ S) : T \ S = ∅ := by sorry

-- Functions do not natively act on elements of sets: how can we fix this code?
example (α β : Type) (S : Set α) (f g : S → β) :
  f = g ↔ ∀ a : α, (ha : a ∈ S) → f a = g a := by sorry













variable (α β : Type) (f : α → β)

-- We can upgrade a function `f` to a function between sets, using the image:
example : Set α → Set β := by sorry















-- The range is not *definitionally equal* to the image of the universal set: use extensionality!
example : range f = f '' univ := by sorry
















-- Why is the following a *statement* and not merely the *definition* of being injective?
example : Injective f ↔ InjOn f univ := by sorry
